# TurtleBot3-Navigation
Using TurtleBot3 packages to navigate a robot into simulation world
<h2>Setup</h2> <br>
start by setting up the workspace enviroment <br>

1- ```mkdir -p ~/test_turtlebot/src``` <br>

create a new workspace <br>
2- ```cd ~/test_turtlebot/src``` <br>

get inside your workspace src file to start cloning clone packages. <br>
<h2>install packages</h2> <br>

1- ```git clone http://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3.git``` <br>

2- ```git clone http://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_msgs.git``` <br>

now go back to your workspace using `cd catkinn` command,and run: <br>

`catkin_make` <br>
to clone packages. then source your terminal using:<br>

```Source ~/test_turtlebot3/devel/setup.bash``` <br>

```Export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger``` <br>

here we are telling the terminal that weâ€™re using the burger model from our packages.<br>
now we will run our gazebo world: <br>

```roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch``` <br>

<h2>Robot Motion</h2> <br>
Now to start moving your robot model, open a new terminal window (from top left cornor) <br>
and start by sourcing this session again using:

```Source ~/test_turtlebot3/devel/setup.bash``` <br>

then will introduce our model again to this session using:

```Export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger``` <br>
finally run:

```roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch``` <br>
